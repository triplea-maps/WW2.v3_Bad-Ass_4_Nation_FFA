						▬►<b><i> Game Description:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						♦ This a 4 nation free for all based on the "WWIIv3" map. The capitals, territory values, canals, national objectives, and technology model are different. So please read game notes below and scan the map well. The core of the MOD is governed by version 3 rules, with the exception of changes listed in game notes. Each nation, New Britain, Germany, Japan & Russia start in their respective capitals, with identical bids and 1 national technology advantage each. The rest of the world is seperated into 2 groups of neutrals. The Green Neutrals (Chinese) hold the very lucrative National Objectives. The Orange Neutrals (True) hold the rest. From there all nations fight it out til a win is declared!<br>
						<br>
						♦ The MOD is designed to give each nation a uniquely challenging, and equal chance at the win. The world is not perfect symmetry, so plan your strategy based on your geographic location, national strengths, and lastly but certainly not least, adjust your tactics as needed to counter your immediate threats and to exploit your enemies weaknesses. If the world were 100% perfectly symmetrical no one would win. So that being said, all forms of diplomatic negotiations are allowed via combinations of the chat function and the game supported diplomatic actions. From a simple agreement and friendly cooperation to non-aggression pacts and alliances of mutual interests. However long term alliances are discouraged in order to keep within the proper spirit of the free for all game concept. Not to mention your so called long term ally will certainly backstab you in the end anyways. <b>There can only be one!</b><br>

						▬►<b><i> Victory Conditions:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• Victory is achieved by "Projection Of Power" win condition of 10 "Victory Cities" (VC). Your nation must continuously hold at least 10 of the same VC for 1 turn, which basicly means hold the 10 VC until the start your following turn. Also your capital must be 1 of the 10 VC held.  The 1st nation to declare 10 VC held for 1 turn, wins! View history to verify win if needed, win is "player enforced".<br> 
						<br>
						→<i> Note: Any victory conditions other than those listed above must be clearly and unanimously accepted before the game begins. However, if you want to just vary game length and still maintain the best balance integrity, then I recommend changing the bid amount rather than VC victory conditions.</i><br>
						<br>
						→<i> Alternate Way To Play: Try a 2v2 game if you have 4 humans players and want some more variety, or have only 2 to 3 human players and you don't want AI. Pick any 2v2 combination of nations and your team wins if 1 of the 2 nations reach the 10 VC "Projection Of Power". Your nations are not true allies, just team mates. VC are not shared, defending together or entering each others territories is not permitted. Also you cannot attack or take your team mates territories in any way, this includes blitzes. Good coordination is critical to get the win. For this game, I recommend uncheck "use" for Chinese in player selection game setup phase to disable their Chinese reinforcements.</i><br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Optional - "Risk" Style Setup Rules:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• Below is a great optional "Risk" style setup in which each player nation starts the game with more owned territories via pre-bid selections. Don't under estimate the importance of these territory selections, they involve strategic decisions that may posess the ability to make or break someones game. This setup usually accelerates the battle action, has the potential of speeding up a victory, and will definately increase early strategy possiblities beyond what is available in a standard game setup. Disclaimer, noobs can create big balance shifts in this setup. <br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: I intend to code the following optional setup into future game versions, but for now players will need to use the game EDIT feature to select territories and make infantry adjustments. Its very easy to do.</i><br>
						<br> 
						• Pre-Bid Territory Selection Rules For 8 PUs Setup<br>
						<br>
						• 1) Before the bid phase begins, each nation picks 8 PUs worth of orange territories, one territory at a time and in following order until done, New Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia. <br>
						<br>
						• 2) Players can pick any combination of orange territories to equal 8 PUs, (e.g. eight 1 PUs ters or two 4 PUs ters). If picking more valuable territories, it  will complete your nations picks sooner, while others continue in order til they reach 8 PUs worth.<br>
						<br>
						• 3) Each newly picked orange territory, will recieve a number of free infantry which will be equal to the territory value and the free infantry must go in their corresponding territories only. Each nation will end up with 8 free infantry placed in the corresponding 8 PUs worth of new territories.<br>
						<br>
						• Thats it, your done. Once steps 1 to 3 are completed, the bid phase starts, just follow rules below regarding bid unit placements. Grab a game save here if needed and reload to begin bid phase as normal.<br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: Steps 1 to 3 are done via edit mode, the japs player must do all edits because the japs are 1st in the bid order, also the edits must be done before the bid phase actually begins. It just requires, edit of territory ownerships, add new owners infantry and remove the original owners infantry. So if needed let someone familiar with editing temporarily be the japs player so things go fast and smoothly. Save game and reload it to give japs back to the intented player.</i><br>
						<br>
						• During the bid phase, you can place land and air bid units in these newly picked territories in addition to the free infantry already there. The number of bid units that can be placed is equal to the territory value (e.g. 3 tanks, 3 artillery in a 6 PUs territory and 1 tank, 1 fighter in a 2 PUs territory).<br>
						<br>
						• During the bid phase, you can place any air or land units in the newly picked territories except for factories which are not allowed during bid phase. Naval bid units are only allowed in the designated seazone next to each capital and capitals have temporary unlimited unit placement during the bid phase.<br>
						<br>
						• During the bid phase, regarding New Britains Bunker tech, a maximum of 1 bunker per newly picked territory is allowed. It counts as 1 bid unit towards the total number of bid units allowed to be placed in the territory, and is in addition to the free infantry that are already there.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Victory Cities List:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• There is a total of 28 "Victory Cities" throughout the world. VC territories have yellow stars in them and if viewed with the territory tab and/or "I or V" keyboard shortcuts, the info will display "Is a Victory Location".<br>
						<br>
						• Borneo and Sikang are exceptions to the above. The yellow star is located underneath the land units, which makes it is very hard to see the yellow stars, but rest assured they are VC.<br>
						<br>
						• France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Norway, Poland, Ukraine, Caucasus, Russia, Karelia, Archangel, Egypt, South Africa, Madagascar, Persia, India, East Indies, Borneo, Australia, Japan, Manchuria, Kwangtung, Sikang, Chinghai, Eastern USA, Western USA, Panama, Brazil<br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: If you wanna get crazy, play till all nations fall or simply concede to your dominance, you'll be looking at a 50+ round game.</i><br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Neutrals:</i></b><br>
						<br>
                        • Set Chinese Neutrals <i>(green territories)</i> and True Neutrals <i>(orange territories)</i> to "Hard AI" and "Do Nothing AI" respectively, so someone needs to host to do this.<br>
                        <br>
						• All green territorries <i>(Chinese)</i> make-up 12 national objectives, see national objectives list further below for details.<br>
						<br>
						• Chinese Neutrals <i>(green territories)</i> may build up to 3 infantry <i>(AI reinforcements)</i> per turn, per territoy up to a maximum limit of 18 infantry in a single territory. All Chinese units are static defenders only, currently no movements or attacks of any kind are allowed.<br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: You can disable Chinese AI reinforcemnets by unchecking the "use" box located next to China in the player selection phase of game setup, however you still must select an "AI type".</i><br>
						<br>
						• True Neutrals <i>(orange)</i> are only static defenders and do nothing else.<br>
						<br>
						• Neutral territory <i>(green & orange)</i> flyovers by enemy planes and rockets is allowed.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Bidding Order:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• Japan<br>
						• Germany<br>
						• Russia<br>
						• New Britain<br>
						<br>
						• Set Bids to 450PUs for approx. 10 to 20 round game.<br>
						• Set Bids to 350PUs for approx. 10 to 20+ round game. - Default<br>
						• Set Bids to 250PUs for approx. 20 to 30+ round game.<br>
						<!--<br>
						• <b>Buying Tech Tokens during bid phase and/or saving more than 12PUs of your bid is currently forbidden.</b><br>-->
						<br>
						→<i> Note: Game lengths are still mostly dependant on players agressiveness and overall strategies.</i><br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: The higher the bids go beyond above listed, the higher the tendency to skew intended game dynamics and balance. Play testing suggests the default Bid is currently ideal. However your welcome to experiment.</i><br>

						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Sequence of Phases in a Turn:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• <b>Collect Income</b> - This phase is a major change. It requires you to hold conquered territories and/or national objectives for 1 turn in order to collect PUs for them. <br>
						→<i> Note: Dis-regard the "end of turn" text in the economic report prompt in older engine versions (pre.7342). The prompt functions as the start of players turn.</i><br>
						• <b>Research Technology</b> - Directly select the technology you desire. Required Tech Tokens are purchased during the purchase phase. Ability to directly select techs should allow you to build an army and/or strategy around a technology with absolute certainty. <br>
						• <b>Diplomacy</b> - Preform diplomatic actions with other nations. <br>
						• <b>Combat Move</b> - This is combat move 1 of 2. Do some, all, or none of your combat moves here. Knowing exactly what your attacks will look like before purchase should simplify overall planning and reduce mistakes. <br>
						• <b>Repair Infrastructure</b> - Repair any strategic bombing and/or rocket damages to factories, bunkers, etc...<br>
						• <b>Purchase</b> - Buy all game units here, also buy Tech Tokens here for use during research technology phase.<br>
						• <b>Combat Move</b> - This is combat move 2 of 2. Complete any remaining combat moves you may have.<br>
						• <b>Fire Rockets</b> - If you have Rocket Tech, choose targets for rockets and launch them.<br>
						• <b>Combat</b> - All battles you just initiated take place.<br>
						• <b>Non Combat Move</b> - Move all game units with any remaining legal movements.<br>
						• <b>Activate Technology</b> - If any technology was researched earlier, then it activates here.<br>
						• <b>Place and End Turn</b> - Place your purchased units and your end turn.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Technology:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• New technology model enables you to confidently plan your strategies by allowing you to directly choose the technologies that you want.  This model also eliminates 2 potentialy frustrating factors from game, unlucky/lucky tech rolls and tech spamming.<br>
						<br>
						• Tech Tokens are now purchased during the "Purchase" phase and all tokens get used on your following turn during the "Research Technology" phase. Tokens are only sold by the "6 pack" at cost of 40PUs per "6 pack". One "6 pack" is a gauranteed success for one tech.<br>
						<br>
						• Only one technology per turn is allowed and all of your tokens get used during the "Research Technology" phase, so dont buy more than one "6 pack" at time.<br>
						<!--<br>
						• <b>Buying Tech Tokens during bid phase and/or saving more than 12PUs of your bid is currently forbidden.</b><br>-->
						<br>
						•<b>"Technology Developement - Bomber Trifecta Restriction"</b> - Is a selectable game setup option which no longer allows any 1 nation to obtain all 3 air techs, heavy bombers, paratroopers and longrange techs. Basicly if you develop heavy bombers you cant develop paratroopers and vice versa, so pick wisely. Longrange can be developed with either heavy bomber or paratroopers.<br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: "Technology Developement - Bomber Trifecta Restriction" is active with default options settings.</i><br>
						<br>
						•<b>"Technology Developement - Activates On Turn 6"</b> - Is a selectable game setup option which disallows new tech developement until beginning of round 6. This allows national tech advantages to play larger role in early rounds, also further limits tech spamming.<br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: Using "Edit" function for techs may not function for some techs. Depending on which tech and which phase it currently is, the tech may activate on next turn, due to triggers. De-activating will not work at all for some techs.</i><br>
						<br>
                        •<b>"National Tech Advantages"</b> - Regardless of above listed tech options, each nation still starts with 1 activated technology as listed below.<br>
						<br>
						• <b>British - Bunkers</b><br>
						• <b>Germans - Increased Factory</b><br>
						• <b>Japanese - Marines</b><br>

						• <b>Bomber</b> - Cost increased from 12PUs to 14PUs.<br>
						• <b>Cruisers</b> - Have a transport capacity of 1 infantry or marine.<br>
						• <b>Transports</b> - Do not have to unload all units during combat move/noncombat move <i>(i.e. they may unload 1 unit and leave 1 unit aboard)</i>. You may never unload a single transport to multiple territories during a single turn because the transport action is considered finished after it unloads desired unit(s) to the single territory.

						<br>
						▬►<b><i> Factory Rules:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• New factory builds are limted to 2 maximum and cost 25 PUs each. A nation should never have more than 3 factories on the board at any given time. This number includes your original factory in your capital.<br>
						<br>
						• Captured factories are automaticly destroyed. If your factory happens to be destroyed, you may immediately build another factory on your turn in another location to satisfy the above limit.<br>
						<br>
						• You may demolish your own unuseful factories excluding original one in capital, during the purchase phase of your turn via "player enforced" EDIT. You may demolish and build factories on the same turn if you are below the max limit of 3. However, if you are already at the 3 factory limit you <b>cannot</b> demolish and build factories on the same turn.<br>
						<br>
						• You <b>cannot</b> place new naval units in hostile sea zones and all enemy naval units are considered hostile. This option currently can't be defined further to exclude naval units, for instance transports or subs, so we just deal with it. <br>
						<br>
						• Factories may be built anywhere, even in a territory with only 1 PUs value . <br>
						• Maximum production in a factory is identical to territory PUs value. <br>
						• There is a 1 factory per territory limit. <br>

						▬►<b><i> Capitals Pillaging Bonus:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• When you occupy an enemy capital, you immediately take any money they may have in the bank.<br>
						<br>
						• A pillaging bonus of 65 PUs per occupied capital is given in addition to any money robbed from their national banks. This represents a quick pillaging of the city and is given after all of your possible combat is completed. But before the end of your turn. <br>
						<br>
						• Each nation may pillage any given capital, only once per game. However a capital can be pillaged by another nation, even if it has previously been pillaged. <br>
						<br>
						→<i> Note: Albeit with this bonus, you theoreticly can collect an income while your capital is occupied. You still can't spend the income if you don't hold your own capital.</i><br>

						▬►<b><i> Other Stuff:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• Use LowLuck, "Projection of Power" win condition <i>(10 victory cities)</i> and no new tech developement for the <b>most balanced game</b>. Game balance integrity remains reasonable with "dice" and new "Tech Developement - Activates On Turn 6" & "Technology Developement - Bomber Trifecta Restriction" options checked, but if you like <b>bigger balance swings</b>, feel free to experiment.<br>
						<br>
                        • Try to limit your turn to <b><i>average 7.5 minutes</i></b>, so do the majority of your plotting, calculating and negotiating on others turns.<br>
						<br>
						• <b>Playing with AI</b> controlled nations works ok if you use the following suggestions. Give the AI nations 10PUs "AI Bonus Income Flate Rate", via options. Edit in, Artillery Tech for AI land powers and SuperSubs Tech for AI sea powers in addition to what they already have. The tech edits must be done during the bid phase before the actual round 1 to avoid tech trigger errors. Human players should agree to an AI friendly bid purchase, meaning units that AI actually uses well. Place the AI's bid and then grab a save and reload so you can set "Hard AI" as in control of AI nation. Lastly the best nations to be AI controlled in order are Russia, Germany or New Britain, and Japan <i>(AI seems the worst for Japs)</i>. Someone needs to host to use AIs because bots dont allow AI useage.<br>
						<br>
						• If someone needs to leave, flakes-out or rage-quits <b>before game is decided</b> and/or agreed play time expires, etc... Then save game til another time, substitute the player, or use the above listed suggestions with "Hard AI", another less appealing option is use "Do Nothing AI", remaining players decide. Unfortunately this happens alot, but on brightside if it was a flake-out/rage-quit you'll know for next time if the player is worthwhile.<br>
						<br>
						<hr>
						<br>
						▬►<b><i> "EDIT" Etiquette:</i></b><br>
						<br>
						• Editing movement related "game engine bugs" and following the "House Rules" is simply required to play. <br>
						<br>
						• Editing player mistakes is discretionary and requires an unanimous vote by all players to be allowed. Please dont get too mad if you don't get your "EDIT". I suggest the <b>"Rule of Thumb"</b> be used in addition. <br>
						<br>
						•<b> "Rule of Thumb"</b> - In my opinion if its still the players turn and no combat rolls have taken place, then the player should always be allowed an "EDIT". It happens to everyone and will eventually happen to you as well. However once actual combat rolls take place, things get messy because it raises all kinds of <b>"what if"</b> questions, so in this case to avoid arguments, vote on it. If the players turn has already ended, vote on it. <br>
